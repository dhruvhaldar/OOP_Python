    "### 📝 Explanation\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 1. Uniform Interface\n",
    "\n",
    "The fleet manager doesn’t care whether it’s a Car, Bike, Truck, or ElectricCar.\n",
    "\n",
    "It just calls `start()`, `info()`, and `stop()` on each one.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 2. Different Implementations\n",
    "\n",
    "`Car.start() → \"Toyota Camry (Car) is starting...\"`\n",
    "\n",
    "`Bike.start() → \"Yamaha R15 (Bike) is roaring to life!\"`\n",
    "\n",
    "`Truck.start() → \"Volvo FH16 (Truck) is starting...\"`\n",
    "\n",
    "`ElectricCar.start() → \"Tesla Model 3 (Electric Car) is powering up silently...\"`\n",
    "\n",
    "Same method calls, *different behaviors*.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 3. State Management\n",
    "\n",
    "The started attribute (initialized in Vehicle) ensures all vehicles share a common state convention, while subclasses control how that state changes.\n",
    "\n",
    "👉 This is a cleaner, more realistic polymorphism demo:\n",
    "\n",
    "You can add vehicles of any type to the fleet without changing fleet_operations.\n",
    "\n",
    "Future subclasses (e.g., Bus, Scooter, Drone) will “just work” as long as they implement start, stop, and info."
